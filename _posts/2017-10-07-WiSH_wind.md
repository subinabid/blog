I am currently working on installation of a 2 MW wind turbine. Lets see how it goes:

**07/10/2017**

Wind turbine installation begins with excavation for the foundation. The bottom is levelled with plain cement concrete (PCC). The foundation bolts required to fix the wind turbine tower is kept in postion to be embeded inside reinforced cement concrete (RCC). To fix the bolts in position, 2 flanges (*top & bottom*) are used which will also be embeded inside the RCC

Meanwhile, the turbine blades are getting ready for despatch at the OEM.

Wind turbine blade size depends on the MW capacity of the machine. The current blade has a length of about 56 mtrs and weighs about 11.5 ton per blade.

>The largest wind turbine in the world has a diameter of about 176 mtr generating 9MW power (peak)

The blades are made of composites. They are hollow inside.

Parts arrive at site for installation. First item to arrive is the **hub** (*The conical front portion of the turbine where the blade gets fixed*)

Blades arrive 2 days later

Tower structure comes in 4 parts

Installation

Installation like this requires massive cranes. The crane is getting ready as the materials arrive at site

>The blue / gray coloured lattice structure is the boom of the (main) crane. As the boom length increases, the lift capacity of the crans decreases. Cranes are assembled using smaller cranes. The small white coloured crans is assembling the bigger crane

Tower structure comes in 4 parts. The first part is put in position and fixed to the foundation using bolts

The second section is getting ready for installation

**19/11/2016**

All 4 sections are erected with Nacelle on the top

>Nacelle houses most of the working components of a wind turbine including gear box, generator, transformer, oil pumps etc

Hub and blades are assembled seperately on the ground.

**30/07/2019 Update**

The largest wind turbine available in the market is [GE Halide x](https://www.ge.com/renewableenergy/wind-energy/offshore-wind/haliade-x-offshore-turbine) with a diameter on 220 mtr, producing 12 MW (peak) of power. To give a perspective on the size of the blades, the new GE blades are as long as my tower itself.
