All of a sudden I feel like setting up my own [website][web]!

Purchased the domain [subinabid.xyz][web] and setup a home page on Github Pages. [Jaseem][ja] recommended jekyll for the blog. If you are able to see this blog, then I have done well so far.

[subinabid.com](subinabid.com) is officially mine!.

I dont like the fonts on my blog.  I was working on a different machine instead of my personal laptop (*an HP X360 which i love absolutely*) and I didnt have access to my github desktop. Started editing the blog on github web directly and the display was so crisp & brilliant. I loved reading it. when the [blog](http://blog.subinabid.xyz/2017/05/27/IT.html) was finally published, the text looked horrible. Especially my blockquote part. The contrast between the git pages and actual blog made me hate it more. 

Wasted no time. The blog css was ripped to look like github and I love it absolutely. Henceforth, *font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol";* is going to be the default till anything major occurs.

I have been reading about [www vs bare domains](http://www.greenhills.co.uk/2011/06/12/www-or-bare-domain.html) recently. Decided to go ahead with a bare domain. Minimal & neat, not a technical decision though.

[subinabid.com](http://subinabid.com) points to subinabid.xyz again. Tried google cloud storage. Works great for static sites, but i still dont know how to make jekyll work on google cloud.
