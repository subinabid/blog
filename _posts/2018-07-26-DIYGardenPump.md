My wife & I grow a few potted plants in our balcony, which we call our private garden :) . We have an [Arduino uno](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3) board lying around the house and we decided to brush up our engineering skills and to make a water pumping system for our garden.

### Components
1. [Arduino uno](https://robu.in/product/arduino-uno-r3-without-cable/)
2. [Arduino motor control shield](https://robu.in/product/9736/)
3. [pump](https://robu.in/product/280-diaphragm-3-7v-self-priming-pump-small-micro-pump-tea-fitting-metering-pump/)
4. Tubing
5. Breadboard, jumpers, etc etc

stay tuned....
