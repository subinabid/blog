I broke my badminton racket recently and decided to buy a new one. Did some research for the same and I thought i could share it. I have used the following badminton rackets:

|Racket|Weight|String|Tension|Remarks|
|------|------|------|------:|------|
|Nanospeed 500|3U|Stock|Stock| This is a heavy racket |
|Nanospeed 500|3U|BG 66 Ultimax|22 lbs| Loved these strings, Repulsion and sound |
|Nanospeed 500|3U|BG 66 Ultimax|23 lbs| |
|Voltric Lite|4U|Stock|stock| Head heavy racket |
|Voltric Lite|4U|BG 66 Ultimax|23 lbs|Felt the smashes were less powerful than my Nanospeed|
|Arcsaber 69 Lite|5U|Stock|stock|Super light weight |
|Arcsaber 69 Lite|5U|BG 66 Ultimax|22 lbs|My favourite strings |
|Voltric 0.7 DG Slim|3U|Aerosonic|25 lbs|I love heavy rackets. The strings did not last though|
|Arcsaber 69 Lite|5U|Li-Ning No7|25 lbs|I am not sure if it is because of the strings or my training, I can drive well with this  |
|Voltric 0.7 DG Slim|3U|Li-Ning No7|25 lbs|Racket setup feels better than before|
|Voltric 0.7 DG Slim|3U|BG 65|25 lbs|Back to Basic Strings|

All Items are from [Yonex](http://yonex.com/) except the latest strings from Li-ning. For those who are new to badminton, 3U is heavier than 5U.


### For those who are trying to buy their first racket

1. There is no point in buying an expensive racket for beginers. Trust me, you get excellent rackets for Rs 1000 or even below. Just avoid the ones with T-joints
2. Yonex makes nice ones, so does Li-ning, Carlton, Ashaway, Apacs, Adidas, etc
3. Dont care about strings at the beginning. Whatever came with the racket is good for starters. Change it in 6 months or when you break it or when you feel its too loose. Yonex BG65 is a great string and 22 lbs is a decent tension. Max tension will be printed on your racket. Beyond that, the racket would break . It would cost you about Rs 500.
4. Mavis 10 is a good shuttle to start with. Go for M350 when your game improves

Have been playing with my [Arcsaber](https://www.sportsuncle.com/yonex-arcsaber-69-light-badminton-racket.html) for a while and I am absolutely in love with it.


### Update on 29/07/2019
I broke my NS500 today, after using it for about 8 years


### Update on 20/10/2019
New set of strings (BG66UM) on my arcsaber. Loved it! 


### Update on 27/10/2020
New addition - Voltric 0.7DG Slim. Yet to play with it, recovering from an ankle injury


### Update - November 2020
I am in love with Voltric + Aerosonic Strings. People advise me to move to lighter racket, but i just love this one. Broke the strings in less than a month


### Update - Jan 2021
Tried Li-Ning No7 Strings on both the rackets - V7DG & A69L. No7 is thicker than anything I have used before. Retains tension for longer period, but broke sooner than I expected. Defenitely heavy on the wrist
Moved to BG65

I broke my Arcsaber 69 lite today. Tbh, I should not have hit it on the floor. Totally my mistake.
