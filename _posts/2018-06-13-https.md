title: Obsession with https

---
I have been obsessed with ***https*** for a while. I love the green padlock more than the *i* in a circle. SO ,when i created [my personal site](https://subinabid.xyz/), this blog, and a [portfolio page](https://portfolio.subinabid.xyz/), I wanted it to be served over https, rather than just http. Of course, I was not setting up a payment page or something that required the visitors to enter their bank or credit card details. But, still, the padlock gave a sense of security.

A recent [blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/05/evolving-chromes-security-indicators.html) by Google expects all the traffic over the internet to be secured by default. I host my stuff on Github pages which did not support https on custom domains initially. Pages on  ```*.github.io<>``` was supported . I used Cloudflare to get the green padlock on the visitor's browsers. I still have no idea how the traffic from Github to cloudflare happens.

Github recently made it possible  (https://blog.github.com/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/) to deliver custom domains over https. You need to update your DNS and wait for it to propogate. Later enforce https in the repo settings. Detailed procedure is found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain/) and [here](https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https/)
