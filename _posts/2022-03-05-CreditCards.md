**Declaration**: I am not an expert on the subject, just learning on the go.
I [wrote]({% post_url 2021-04-11-CreditCards %}) earlier on why everyone should have credit cards and the list of cards I have. I added a few more to the list:


### Amazon Pay Credit Card

[Amazon Pay Credit Card](https://www.amazon.in/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GCQ5L4PNEXQH8KYF)

This is a life time free card issued in association with ICICI bank. Highlights?

- Life time free - No Joining or Yearly fee
- â‚¹750 Amazon Voucher on joining
- 5% rewards on non EMI purchases on amazon for Prime members. 3% for others
- Rewards are credited to amazon pay balance

The is a very rewarding card for someone who makes purchases on Amazon. This could also be the first card for a new user even if they use amazon sparingly. People usually ask what they should choose between SBI Simply Click and Amazon Pay. The answer is simple - Amazon Pay, for 2 obvious reasons - higher rewards and Life time free. Even though the card is issued by ICICI, Some merchants do not identify this as an ICICI cards for certain offers.


### ICICI Sapphiro
