After spending a lot of years in a place where I did not go for movies, I moved to Noida in 2019 and started going to movies again. Of course I [blogged]({% post_url 2021-03-28-movie %}) about it! Last week, I went for another one and this time the ticket - popcorn included :) was free.  Here is how:

**Cost**

| | |
| :--- | ---: |
|3 tickets |1050|
|Popcorn  | 430| 
|Convenience fee
(*I hate this, more on that later*) |156| 
|Misc |3|
|**Total** | **1633**|

**Payment**

| | |
| Gift Voucher | 1500| 
| SBI debit card points | 74|
| Cash | 65|


Gift vouchers are from [HDFC Diners black](https://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/pay/cards/credit-cards/diners-club-black) credit card. When monthly spending is more than 80K, they give you 2 coupons of â‚¹500 each. I picked the voucher for BookmyShow for last 3 months - 500 X 3 = 1500. You get 2 coupons per month and you have to pick 2 separate ones from a list. My other 3 coupons were for [Tata Cliq](https://www.tatacliq.com/) which can be used at Croma too.


SBI debit card reward points is something I started using recently. Just like Credit cards, Debit cards give reward points. You can check it from your net banking. I strongly recommend everyone checking your balance because there is a high chance of a huge accumulated amount. I will be happy to help.
