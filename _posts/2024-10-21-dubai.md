I just came back from a family vacation to Dubai. I went a few days earlier for work and family joined later. We were travalling with our kid and wanted to relax more than seeing a lot of places. I used chatGPT to plan the trip and it was a great experience. Here are some hacks to make your trip to Dubai easier:

## Airport

Dubai airport has 3 terminals. Terminal 1 and 3 are connected and Terminal 2 is a bit far. Terminal 1 & 3 are connected by a metro and you can easily move between the two. Terminal 2 doesnot have a direct metro line and you will have to take a taxi to reach the metro station or the city. Busses area available form Terminal 2 to the city.

| Terminal | Airline                     | Metro  / Taxi / bus |
| :------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------ |
| 3        | Emirates, Quantas           | Metro & taxi        |
| 1        | Indigo, Spicejet            | Metro & taxi        |
| 2        | AirIndia Express, Fly Dubai | Bus & Taxi          |

## Public transport

First thing you should buy is a **NoL card**. This card can be used in metro, bus, tram and water taxi. You can buy the card at the airport or any metro station. The card costs 25 AED which gives a 19 AED balance. (*6 AED is the card cost*). You can top up the card at any metro station or using the NoL app. The card can be used for 5 years. You can also use the card to pay for parking in Dubai. Card is also accepted in some shops and restaurants.

There are 4 card types - **Red, Silver, Blue (Personal) & Gold**. Get a red card only if you want to use the metro once. Silver card is the most common. Gold card is used for Gold class cabins in metro.

| Card Type | Cost (AED) | Balance (AED) | Validity   | Remarks                                                    |
| :-------- | :--------- | :------------ | :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| Red       | 2          | 0             | 90 minutes | Single use                                                 |
| Silver    | 25         | 19            | 5 years    | Most common                                                |
| Blue      | 70         | 50            | 5 years    | Personalised, special rates for students & senior citizens |
| Gold      | 25         | 19            | 5 years    | Access Gold class cabins in metro                          |

> If you have an NFC enabled phone, install the NoL app and you can use your phone to check the card balance. You can also use the phone as a NoL card if you register your card on the RTA app. You can also use the app to top up the card.

> Dubai Metro in association with Lego introduced limited edition Lego themed (Silver) Nol cards and is definitely a collector's item. Card has the features of a silver card. You can buy the card at any metro station for 25 AED.

Minimum fare for metro is 3 AED and for bus is 2 AED. You can also buy a day pass for 20 AED (*or a week pass for 80 AED*) which is valid for unlimited travel in metro and bus for a day (*or week*). You can find the details on [RTA website](https://www.rta.ae/wps/portal/rta/ae/home?lang=en)ÃŸ


There are 2 metro lines in Dubai - Red line and Green line. Red line runs in north-south direction with Airport at the north (Almost) end and expo city / UAE exchange at the south end. Green line runs in the old Dubai area. There are 2 interconnecting stations - Union and Burjuman.  There is a tram line in the Marina area with connection to metro red line at Shoba and DMCC. There are also water taxis which connect the Marina.

Taxi fare starts at 5 AED and is 2 AED per km. There is a 15 AED surcharge for airport taxi - meter starts at 20 AED. The common taxi is the beige colored taxi. Top color - blue or green only means the taxi company and has the same fare. There are also limousine taxis (*number plate will start with letter* `L`) which are more expensive. Pay with cash, NoL or credit cards. You can also use Uber and Careem app in Dubai.

## Stay, location

Dubai is a big city and you can stay anywhere. If you are travelling with family, it is better to stay near a metro station. This will help you in moving around easily. Keep in mind that Dubai is a hot city - 350 mtrs from hotel to Metro station is walkable in the morning but 700 mtrs in the afternoon is not. This is personal though.

## Shopping

Dubai is a shopping paradise. You can find a lot of malls in Dubai. Dubai Mall is the biggest mall in the world. Mall of Emirates is another big mall in Dubai. There is also a ski slope in the mall. Visit Marina Mall for a view of the Marina. You can also visit the Gold Souk in Deira for gold shopping.
