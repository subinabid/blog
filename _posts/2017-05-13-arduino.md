Came across [Arduino][Arduino] boards a few months ago while reading random stuff over the internet. I was planning to buy a board for a while and finally it got delivered.

Spent the day blinking an LED followed by an array of LEDs. Shilpa seems to be excited to get a breadboard after a long time. It was fun time, not surprising for a couple who went ona date to [HAL Museum][HAL]
