**4th Jan 2020**

My grandfather passed away today. He was 92 years old.

We called him *Ameepa*. To this day, I dont know the origin of that name. I assume it has something to do with *Ameen*, the youngest son. I could be absolutely wrong here. 

I remember the man who always wears white, and rarely with a slight hint of pastels. I remember him sitting on the *pattayam* in the kitchen which doubles as our storage space as well as dining table, and enjoying his food. He loved plain rice and fish curry in a house which was always in *Chicken Biriyani* mode. I remember seeing him sitting on the veranda of the mosque nearby, where he chit chats with his friends. 

The last time I met him was a few months ago when I took my son to meet him. The 3 generations had a nice time together, he tryring to talk to his great grand son, who is still grabbing language. Actually it was 4 generations. There is a photo of my father -  who passed away 22 years ago - which hangs in his room. 

May his soul rest in peace.
