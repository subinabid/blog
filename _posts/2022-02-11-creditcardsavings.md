I have been advocating credit cards through my [blog]({% post_url 2021-04-11-CreditCards %}) for a while and I write my experience with cards. I tried to note down the money I saved using various cards over the last 14 months and saved about 86K over the last 14 months using credit cards. Here is a summary of how.
