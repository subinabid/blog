I have been advocating credit cards through my [blog]({% post_url 2021-04-11-CreditCards %}) for a while and I write my experience with cards. I tried to note down the money I saved using various cards over the last 14 months and saved about 86K over the last 14 months using credit cards. Here is a summary of how.
|Sl|Category|Amount|
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
|1 | Reward point | 54k|
|2 | Discount |10k|
|3 | Cash back |11k|
|4 | Voucher |12k|
|  |Total | 86k|

The biggest savings has been from my HDFC Diners Black credit card, mostly in redeeming reward points as flight tickets on HDFC Smartbuy

|HDFC Diners    | 64,729|
|Amex MRC       |10,545 |
