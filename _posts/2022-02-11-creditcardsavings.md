I have been advocating credit cards through my [blog]({% post_url 2021-04-11-CreditCards %}) for a while and I write my experience with credit cards in my blogs. I tried to note down the money I saved using various cards since January 2021 and it comes to about  92K. Here is a summary of how.

|Sl|Category|Amount|
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
|1 | Reward point | 56k|
|2 | Discount |10k|
|3 | Cash back |13k|
|4 | Voucher |13k|
|  |**Total** | **93k**|

The biggest savings has been from my HDFC Diners Black credit card, mostly in redeeming reward points as flight tickets on HDFC Smartbuy. Few high value transactions are:

- HDFC - 15K on flights
- HDFC - 12K on flights
- Amex - 9K on Reward Points
- HDFC - 7.5K Cashback from Croma
- HDFC - 3K Cashback on Apple Ipad


|Card | Amount|
|---            | ---: |
|HDFC Diners    | 68K |
|Amex MRC       |10.5K |
|Citi Rewards   | 3.5K |
|One Card   | 3K |
|Amazon pay   | 2K |
|SBI Simply Click   | 2K |
|ICICI   | 1.5K |

## How?

### HDFC Diners Black
Easiest was with HDFC Diners Black. 8 out of my top 10 deals were on Diners Black and 5 of them were reward point redemptions. 

1. HDFC has a portal called [SmartBuy](https://offers.smartbuy.hdfcbank.com/) where I book all my flight tickets as well as redeem reward points. Usual reward rate is 3.3% for Diners Black, while it gives 10X RPs (i.e. 33.3% ) on flights and hotels booked via SmartBuy. HDFC has recently downgraded this offer from 10X to 5X which is really sad.
2. While shopping on popular sites like Myntra, instead of paying with card on the site, purchase coupons from Smartbuy and pay with coupons. It gives you twin benefits - 5% off on the coupon as well as 2X / 3X reward points  
3. 2X RP on weekend dining simply means 6.6% savings on weekend restaurant bills
4. Free Amazon Prime membership as yearly bonus
5. BookmyShow/ TataCliq vouchers worth 500X2 every month if the spend is more than 80K. Imagine a month where you pay school fee or an Insurance premium or festive shopping.

Diners Black cards were not available for a while due to RBI restrictions. Bank has started issuing these cards again. So Get one if you can. I am looking forward to an upgrade to Infinia, hope to get it soon!

### Amex MRC
Spend 1500 or more 4 times in a month. This would give you 1000RPs every month over and above the regular RPs, which counts to 12K RPs in a year. 

### Other cards
1. IDFC bank gives 750 Amazon Voucher if you spend 15K in first 3 months
2. Onecard gives 30% discount on Swiggy purchases
3. 5% cashback on ICICI Amazon Pay card on purchases made on Amazon
