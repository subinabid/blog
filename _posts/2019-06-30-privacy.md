I have been searching for a few phones on the internet for last 2 days and  now, every site i visit has an advertisement for one of the phones I was looking for.

It was badminton rackets till a few days ago. I broke mine and was googling for some replacement and the ads were all rackets for a week.

It makes me wonder, how should i see this? What exactly is google saying?

1. Looks like you were looking for phones, would you like to ***buy*** this?
2. Looks like you were looking for phones, would you like to buy ***this***?
3. Looks like you were looking for phones, There is an ***offer*** here?
4. Looks like you were looking for phones, There is an offer ***here***?
5. ***I know*** you were looking for phones

The ads seems to be a little biased to me. Out of the 3 phones i looked for, ads for only one of the phones are showing up. May be that is the one available on Amazon? ü§∑‚Äç

Should i see this as a system who is prying on me or as something which shows the ads which are relevent to me? Is this something that reminds me there is an offer on something i was looking for?
