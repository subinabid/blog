I have written enought about my bike [buying experience]({% post_url 2023-10-21-triumph %}). I have also written about the [ownership experience]({% post_url 2023-12-06-superbikes %}). Now, I want to talk about the money. Who makes money when you buy a bike?

Triumph Speed 400 costs INR 306K on road. Here is the breakup:

| Sl | Item | Cost |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| 1 | Cost of bike | 180K |
| 2 | GST on bike | 50K |
| 3 | Registration | 50K |
| 4 | Insurance | 21K |
| 5 | GST on Insurance | 5K |
| 6 | Total | 306K |

> 1 + 2 is the ex showroom price  
4 + 5 is the total insurance cost  
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 is the onroad price  
Note: The numbers are approximate.

## Who gets the money?

| Sl | Who gets the money? | Amount | % of total  | Remarks |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- |
| 1 | Triumph | 180K | 59% | Cost of bike (1) |
| 2 | Government | 105K | 34% | GST + Registration (2 + 3 + 5) |
| 3 | Insurance company | 21K | 7% | Insurance (4) |
| 4 | Total | 306K | | |

Triumph gets 180K. That is 59% of the cost of the bike. The government gets 105K. That is 34% of the cost of the bike. The insurance company gets 21K. That is 7% of the cost of the bike. 

### Welcome, Income taxes
I am a person paying 30% income tax. To make 306K for the bike, I actually have to earn 438K. That is 132K in taxes. Adding the 132K to the 105K, the government makes 237K. 

| Sl | Who gets the money? | Amount | % of total | Remarks |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- |
| 1 | Triumph | 180K | 41% | Cost of bike |
| 2 | Government | 237K | 54% | Income tax + GST + Registration |
| 3 | Insurance company | 21K | 5% | Insurance |
| 4 | Total | 438K | |

#### The government makes more money than Triumph!

### What if you were a business owner?
If you were a business owner, buying the bike in your company name, cost of the bike (1), registration (3) and insurance (4) would be a business expense. You would not have to pay income tax on the 251K. The GST (2 + 5) of 55K would be an expense. You would get a refund of the 55K.
