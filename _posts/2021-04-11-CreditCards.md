**Declaration**: I am not an expert on the subject, just learning on the go.

I hold a few credit cards and people ask me why i hold more than one. True reason is for the various offers, and the curiosity of trying a new card. Here is the list of cards: 

### HDFC Diners Black

This is my primay card and I have been using various cards of HDFC for more than 10 years. Annual charge for this card is 10,000 which will be waived off if you spend 5 lakh in a year. Few of the benefits that you will actually use are Amazom prime membership, Zomato pro membership, unlimet lounge access at airport etc. If your monthly billing is >80K, you get vouchers from bookmyshow, tatacliq etc
