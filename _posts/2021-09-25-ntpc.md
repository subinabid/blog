Today marks my 10 years in NTPC Ltd.


I joined NTPC on 26th September 2011 as an Executive Trainee. From there, over the last 10 years, I grew to be an Assistant Manager, Deputy Manager & Manager. What all happened over the last 10 years?


## Salary

My first salary was 44K in October 2011. After 10 years it is about 175K before the government puts their hand into it. It grew 4 times over the last 10 years and I pay income tax of about 4 lakh per year. Till about a year back, I felt i am paid enough. But now I feel i am overworked and underpaid.


## Subordinates

There was someone who I could loosely call as a subordinate for some time in my career. There is no one reporting to me as on today and looking at the way things proceed, I dont expect anyone as a junior for next 5 years atleast.


## Locations

My first location of posting in 2011 - for my initial training -  was at Dadri in UP. Its about 40 KM from Noida. Back in those days, I felt i have reached some godforesaken  place. Little did I know that it was one of the coveted locations in  NTPC. Cooincidently, I visited the same place today for official work.


Next 8 years was at Kudgi in Bijapur District of North Karnataka. It was another remote corner of the world when I reached there and the town grew with us over the period.


I am currently at Noida for almost 2 years 


## What I do

Kudgi days were construction days. We were building a power plant out of barren land. Managing contractors would be the brief deccription of my job. These days, I sit in morning meeting for almost an hour a day and talk to my assigned project locations asking them random questions. I make random reports and presentations and write software sometimes


## What now?

Sabbatical maybe? Probably its time to move on because my work doesnot interest me anymore and the salary is becoming less attractive day by day. 


## Thanks

I should thank my friends who joined with me and are still in touch. They are one of the best parts of my career - Vinod, Joby, Vivek, Sattibabu .. And others who I met on the way - Vikram,   .. I am thankfull to the amazing bosses and mentors I had -  MN Prasad, KS Rajeev, AK Manohar, Raveendran, Muthuraj, Bala, RM Maiya, KG Warrier, Anand Mishra,  Nagesha.. And a lot of other people who helped me in my career - THey are the reason for what I am today.
